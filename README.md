# Kerry Woodall — Homepage

This is a minimal static homepage intended for publishing with GitHub Pages.

How to publish:

- Create a repository on GitHub and push this project to the repository root.
- In the repository Settings → Pages, set the source to the `main` branch (or `gh-pages` branch) and root.
- The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (or your custom domain).

Preview locally:

```bash
# from this repo root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Replace contact details and project links in `index.html` as needed.
